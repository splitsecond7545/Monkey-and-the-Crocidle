Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamun tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest there lived a crocidle and his wife. One day, the crocidle came to the banks of a river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocidle came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them. As days passed by, the crocidle and the monkey became good friends
